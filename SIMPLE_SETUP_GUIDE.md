# 🚀 Simple Automated Assignment System (No ML Required!)

## ✅ **What's Been Simplified**

I've removed all the ML complexity and created a **simple skill-based assignment system** that:

- ✅ **No ML Server Required**: Works without Python/Flask server
- ✅ **Simple Skill Matching**: Uses worker skills + performance + experience
- ✅ **Easy Setup**: Just need Supabase database
- ✅ **Fast & Reliable**: No external dependencies

## 🎯 **How It Works**

The system automatically assigns workers to tasks based on:

1. **Skill Match (40%)**: How well worker skills match task requirements
2. **Performance Score (30%)**: Worker's overall performance rating  
3. **Experience (20%)**: Years of experience (max 20 points)
4. **Accuracy (10%)**: Recent accuracy average

## 🚀 **Quick Setup**

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase Database

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: `kequigxmxlocgrzmlvyt`
3. **Go to SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. **Copy and paste** the entire `supabase_setup.sql` file
5. **Click "Run"** to create tables and sample data

### Step 2: Start the Application

```bash
# Start the frontend (no ML server needed!)
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the System

1. **Open browser**: http://localhost:8080
2. **Go to Manager Dashboard** → **Test Assignment** tab
3. **Click "Test Automated Assignment"**
4. **View Results** in Task Assignment tab

## 🎮 **What You Can Do**

### **Manager Dashboard**
- ✅ **Generate New Day**: Automatically assign 100 workers to 5 tasks
- ✅ **View Assignments**: See all current assignments with skill match %
- ✅ **Explain Decisions**: Click "Explain" to see why each worker was assigned
- ✅ **Testing Pool**: Manage workers in evaluation phase
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: See changes immediately

### **Worker Dashboard**  
- ✅ **View Assigned Task**: See your current task assignment
- ✅ **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as completed to earn XP
- ✅ **AI Chatbot**: Ask questions about tasks (English/Tamil)
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Monitor performance and skills

## 📊 **Assignment Algorithm**

For each of the 5 tasks, the system:

1. **Calculates Score** for each available worker:
   ```
   Score = (Skill Match × 0.4) + (Performance × 0.3) + (Experience × 0.2) + (Accuracy × 0.1)
   ```

2. **Selects Top 20 Workers** with highest scores

3. **Creates Assignments** in Supabase database

4. **Updates Worker Status** to "Assigned"

## 🎯 **The 5 Main Tasks**

1. **Engine Assembly** (Hard) - Requires Engine Assembly skills
2. **Painting & Finishing** (Medium) - Requires Painting skills  
3. **EV Battery Pack Assembly** (Hard) - Requires EV Battery skills
4. **CKD Kit Packing** (Easy) - Requires CKD Kitting skills
5. **Quality Inspection** (Medium) - Requires Quality Inspection skills

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### If you see "Supabase is not configured":
1. Check `.env.local` file exists in project root
2. Restart the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### If you see "assignments table does not exist":
1. Run the SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Verify tables exist in Supabase Table Editor

## 🎉 **Ready to Test!**

The system is now **much simpler** and **easier to set up**:

- ❌ **No ML Server** - Removed Python/Flask dependency
- ❌ **No Complex ML** - Simple skill-based matching
- ✅ **Just Supabase** - Only database needed
- ✅ **Fast & Reliable** - Works immediately

**Start the app and test the automated assignment system!** 🚀
